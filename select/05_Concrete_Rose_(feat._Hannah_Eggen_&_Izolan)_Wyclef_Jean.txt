From the crack of the concrete
Rose can still grow

One time for Mac A Zoe
Two times for the Que
God bless his soul
Now I'm a worldstar
God bless the zoes
See the blimp up in the sky
And say the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
See the blimp up in the skies
Oh the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
You see that blimp up in the sky
Yeah the world is yours

Yeah flags up
Hands higher
Wave em around like a helicopter
Flags up
Put your rags higher
Wave em around like a helicopter
What's good?
Sak'afet
Mèsi Bondye
I ain't in the feds
Back in the days under my tongue
I kept a switch blade
Screw face on the ground
Like the subways
But like the king
I had a dream
Now my name on fire everywhere like hot wings
Barbarian barbaric with the bars
Toussaint Louverture's pumping through my blood
Roll that Afghanistan
I ain't hollywood but I'm on lalaland
Police cuffed me took my bandana
I'm too legit to quit
Even when they pull that hammer

One time free Mac A Zoe
Two times for the Que
Bless his soul
Now I'm a Worldstar
God bless the zoes
See the blimp up in the sky
And say the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
See the blimp up in the skies
Oh the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
Yeah the world is yours
You see that blimp up in the skies

Yeah flags up
Hands higher
Wave em around like a helicopter
Flags up
Put your rags higher
Wave em around like a helicopter
