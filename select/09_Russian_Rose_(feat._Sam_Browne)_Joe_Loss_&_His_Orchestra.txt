Can't you hear me calling
While your tears are falling
Where the river Volga flows?
Though your heart is filled with pain
My lovely Russian rose
Now the skies are overcast
But we'll find peace at last
And live in sweet repose
Then your tears won't be in vain
My lovely Russian rose
Soon the day will come
When you and I
Will both be free
To live
To live and laugh
And love forever
I will come and find you
Break the chains that bind you
When the buds peep through the snow
You will surely bloom again
My lovely Russian rose
