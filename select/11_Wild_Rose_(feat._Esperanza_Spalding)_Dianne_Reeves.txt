Listen
To the wild rose in bloom
In her tune
Strength and beauty
Grow with the days unfolding
Each layer of her perfume
I want to move that free and full
Like the wild rose,
Like the wild rose

I'd been growing happy
In the gardens
'Neath the open sun
Each of my finest roses
Trimmed and bunched into a vase
Lovers and florists
Flocked to buy and sell

Till petals started falling
From my pretty little face
_____ ____ ___ my breath
Big time cultivators came to counsel me
With bouquets and tips
About how successful plots
Need some controls if they're to grow

Promising next year
If I pruned my branches and locked my hips
I'd have more roses and more hands
To help me reap and sow

While they were talking 'round me
A wild breeze wafted by
And wrapped its song around me
Before I crossed their dotted line
I listened

To the wild rose in bloom
In her tune
Strength and beauty
Opened my heart unfolding
Each layer of her perfume
And I knew I could bloom and move
Like the wild rose

A wild will to grow took me over
And out grew my roots and seed
The florists scattered
Songs grew out of my thorns and leaves
Never knew they mattered--
They matter

To grow my Self in full
And show out loud
That more than pretty roses,
Of me I'm proud
To be that free and full
Like the wild rose
In my tune
Strength and beauty
Growing for days unfolding

I've been growing happy
In my fullness, stretching in the sun
Each of my roses blooming out
And singing their own song
Now people passing through the gardens
Like to stop and hear
Some even open up and start to sing along
For every rose still longing
For a new breeze to come by
Listen for the wild rose
As she sings her song on high

Just listen
To the wild rose in bloom
In her tune strength and beauty
Grow with the days unfolding
Each layer of her perfume
I want to bloom that free and full
Call me wild rose
Call me Wild Rose
