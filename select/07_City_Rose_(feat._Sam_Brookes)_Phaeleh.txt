Right in the heart of the city,
I saw shadow that you breathe.
Feet stampeding on me.
I ask myself, "Is this real?"

Right in the heart of the city,
I saw shadow that you breathe.
Feet stampeding on me.
I ask myself, "Is this real?"

But I am pulled towards her;
She's my city rose.
No others bend towards me.
She's the calm in me, but she's the bones I know.
My city rose.

Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows?
Who knows, who knows, who knows?
Who knows, who knows, who knows?
Who knows, who knows?
Right in the heart of city.

Right inthe heart of the city,
I saw shadow that you breathe.
She lays still, but only...
I ask myself, "Is this real?"

But I am pulled towards her;
She's my city rose.
Though others bend towards me.
She's the calm in me, but she's the bones I know.
My city rose.
