She don't drink chardonnay, she drinking rosé, uh, yeah
Icy nigga, need a couple bands when I show face, uh
Basquiat drip, paint a picture when it's in my lane, uh
Car cost 'bout four hundred, why they ask why I spin in the Wraith
Floral garments on me look like some drapes
Chanel double C's on me, can't catch no case
Cartier your handcuffs, you stuck with me, bae
Say rose gold your color diamonds
Drip, nigga, they gon' televise it

If I got a shot then you know I'm fine
Call some shooters, tell 'em never mind
Hella hoes, I got hella vibes
Lot of money coming like I'm taking tithes
Come on, baby, you can take a ride
Jetlag, she getting tired of flying
Trickin' this ho, it been a lot of eyes
So I keep it on me when I'm outside
I heard that a rat just got killed, that's another mouse died
Yeah, that kind gotta stay from,
'Cause a real nigga ain't gon' say nothin'
I'ma stay chasing, you gon' stay crumbing
Pocket full, I'ma stay thumbing
Blue strips, got straight hundreds
Told her relax, you straight hunting
Uh, yeah, I like to ball with my bitch
Yeah, I got a whole lot of chips
And I spent a bag at Phipps
Got ice on hit
Yes, I got diamonds on dancing
Oil this bitch out, let her paint at the mansion
Aviators, she no planning the landing
Keyz and Wheezy made a wave like Atlantic
Daily dripping, spend these racks and we splashing
In the hills, niggas trapping and banging

She don't drink chardonnay, she drinking rosé, uh, yeah
Icy nigga, need a couple bands when I show face, uh
Basquiat drip, paint a picture when it's in my lane, uh
Car cost 'bout four hundred, why they ask why I spin in the Wraith
Floral garments on me look like some drapes
Chanel double C's on me, can't catch no case
Cartier your handcuffs, you stuck with me, bae
Say rose gold your color diamonds
Drip, nigga, they gon' televise it

She just be watching my moves
Diamonds, they wet like a pool
I got a hell of a view
None of this shit, it ain't new
I never made it through school
'Cause I was breaking the rules
Making plays and making the news
I'm having meetings with Jews
I cannot fuck with these bitches
'Cause these bitches basic and I do not want no relations
She suck on my dick and she all on her knees
She say I'm amazing, she just want to taste it
Whole lot of racks in my britches
I'm only rocking Amiris
They steady asking for pictures
I really came from the trenches
We in them foreign cars, we don't stop at the light
And I'm riding with my niggas if they wrong or right
Don't do no barking, my dawgs, they gon' bite
Diamonds, they hittin' in the dark with no light
Can't fall in love with no groupie ho
I fell in love with the studio
Shoot with So Icey like I'm in the movie roll
Shoot his ass dead, we don't give a fuck who he know

She don't drink chardonnay, she drinking rosé, uh, yeah
Icy nigga, need a couple bands when I show face, uh
Basquiat drip, paint a picture when it's in my lane, uh
Car cost 'bout four hundred, why they ask why I spin in the Wraith
